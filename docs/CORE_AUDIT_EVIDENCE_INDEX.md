## Evidence retention rule

For final audit submission, retain the relevant workflow run IDs, job summaries, test output, commit SHA, pull-request merge record, and any organizational evidence outside GitHub in the designated audit evidence repository.

## Evidence quality rule

Evidence must be traceable, dated, scope-specific, and tied to the audited software version. Screenshots or narrative statements alone are not sufficient where machine-verifiable evidence is available.
